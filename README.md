This is a practice project created by Floris999 to gain experience with object-oriented programming (OOP) and working with classes in PHP. It's worth noting that this project is a learning exercise and may not adhere to best practices or be suitable for production use.

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to create a family dashboard where family members can view and manage various aspects of their family life. It includes features like giving and tracking family members' scores and displaying an average score.

## Project Status

This project is still a work in progress, and improvements and enhancements are ongoing. It serves as a valuable learning experience to explore PHP, OOP, and web development concepts. Feel free to check back for updates and improvements.
